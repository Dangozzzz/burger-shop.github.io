# Let it Snow

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jasonhibbs/pen/DmvgeP](https://codepen.io/jasonhibbs/pen/DmvgeP).

Here we’re animating two backgrounds of highly compressed images at slightly different speed to create the illusion of depth (otherwise known as a parallax effect), and illustrate a gentle snowfall.

There’s no fallback in this demo, simply because the data URI’s are cruft enough.

But, happy holidays one and all.
